CCTools Packaging Test
-----------------------

These simple scripts perform end-to-end installation tests of cctools
using our three distribution methods -- conda, spack, and github --
against various integration partners -- parsl, coffea, shadho -- and others.

A periodic github action is used to trigger this script and verify
the end user experience.
